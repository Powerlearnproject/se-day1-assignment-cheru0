Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
It is the systematic application of engineering principles to the design, development, testing ,deployment and maintaining of software systems.It focuses on creating reliable, efficient and scalable software solutions by following structured methodologies,best practices and programming techniques 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
the birth of programming languages_ early computers were programmed using machine code and later assembly language which was tedious and error prone
the rise of structured programming _software development became kore complex,leading to the need for structured programming techniques 
the emergence of object oriented programming 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning- determines project feasibility,scope and objectives 
requirements analysis- gathers and Document user system requirements 
design- create system architecture and database models
implementation- developers write code based on the design specifications
testing- Identifies and fixes bugs through various testing methods 
deployment- releases the software for users
maintainance- fixes bugs, updates software and improves functionality 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall model is linear and sequential while Agile is iterative and flexible 
in Waterfall each phase is completed before moving to the next while Agile the work is done in small increments with continuous feedback 
in Waterfall development there is heavy documentation whereas Agile minimal documentation and focuses more on working softwares 
Waterfall- government or legal systems such as court case management system 
agile- mobile startup setup 


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer 
writes and maintain the codename to develop software applications. they understand and implement software requirements, writes clean efficient and maintainable code and also debuts and fixes software bugs
quality assurance- ensures the software meets quality standards before release. they design and executes test cases and test plans
project manager- oversee the entire project lifecycle, ensuring timely delivery within budget. they define project scope,timeline and deliverables.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide comprehensive tools for software development. 
VCS tool that helps developers track and manage changes to code over time, enabling collaboration and ensuring that code can be easily reverted to previous versions when necessary .

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
ensuring code quality. they can do unit testing and test driven development 
dealing with scope creep. they can use Agile methodologies.
managing complex codebases. they can do modularization and refactoring.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

unit testing- Involves testing individual components or units of as software application in isolation to ensure that each part functions as expected 
integration testing- process of testing how multiple components or systems work together. it focuses on the interaction between integrated units or external systems.
system testing- tests the complete software system as a whole, ensuring that all components and features function together correctly as expected in a fully integrated environment.
acceptance testing- performed by end users or clients to verify that the software meets the specified requirements and is ready for release.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
refers to the process of designing and refining input queries or prompts to communicate effectively with ai models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague- tell me about climate change
improved- explain the main causes of climate change and their impact on global weather patterns in less than 200 words
the improved version helps ai generate a relevant,  specific and concise response aligned with users needs. it minimizes the chances of irrelevant information making the interaction more efficient
